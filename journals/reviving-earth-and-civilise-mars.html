          It’s a morning but still dark. The world is almost in the edge of end. Pollution and other human activities is pushing the earth towards its end. There is no polar ice left. Low lying lands are completely flooded. Many deserts are the witness of global warming because they were green lands before. Very few lands still remain habitable mostly due to their geographical location. Lands near the arctic pole used to have layers of snow covering them almost throughout the year. They warmed up and became green. Many diseases are taking over among them many are unidentified. This devastating environment wiped out ⅔ of the population. Among the alive many are in their death beds. Since earth had a huge population of 12 billion before disaster still around 4 billion are still alive who are passing days in distress
Many scientists anticipated this many years ago. That’s why they were building a huge spaceship to be the second home of humanity. They arranged it in such a way that it can accommodate a huge number of people for some good number of years. While the scientists were building it many people laughed and made fun of it saying it was only a waste of money. However this futuristic spacecraft became there second home
The futuristic spaceship was named ‘HOME2'. People still didn’t managed to make Mars habitable. So they would stay in the spaceship for as long as possible and work to make Mars habitable for supporting human lives. Since a few were lucky to be in the spaceship the rest remained. The left people migrated to the habitable jones near arctic pole where some greenery still remained.
In this period many species of animals got removed from Earth forever. Some areas changed dramatically from good to bad and from bad to worse. But human are the best creation of creator. There was a very reason of being best creation. The left people passed days in complete darkness. They lost their loved ones, their homes, lands and pretty much everything. But British columnist Allison Pearson once said, “Time is a great healer". As time passed people started their new lives. Some people never lose hope. They always try and try to achieve something. Some people still didn’t lose hope. They wanted to revive Earth back to supporting lives. They wanted to bring back the days of peace.
People in HOME2 were passing their days through depression and anxiety as they left Earth for no specified time. The celebrities, talented scientists and the people who could help people were only taken in the spaceship. The scientists who made the spaceship positioned it in the higher orbit of Mars since Mars was visited before and different human settlements were built there. So, people in the spaceship were trying to make Mars as habitable as possible. Huge glaciers were found in the poles of Mars and the chances that Mars used to support life many years ago are also possible. Although there are very limited oxygen it can support men for good number of years in the spaceship. The scientists are using solar energy. They also made an area where plants could be grown thus supply of oxygen and food increased. A new civilization was going to be started in Mars. People in the spaceship were visiting Mars from there spaceship to create a civilisation in Mars.
On the other hand the leftover people in Earth were trying to increase the areas of there living. Since they don’t want to hurt the world more they didn’t cut down trees but made their homes in trees. So they were trying to increase their areas of living but planting more trees. Due to disasters and many other occurrences the rivers and other water sources were heavily polluted and rarely drinking waters were found. People started cultivating crops but because of climate. it was a hard thing. People started to working hands with hands to make things better. By the coarse of time, people were increasing their areas of living by slowly making the inhabitable lands habitable starting from the edges.
People in the spaceship were trying there best to create there civilization in Mars. The biggest problem was the soil and atmosphere. The soil was only able to support very little number of plants. Scientists were researching how to create plants capable of living in the soil of Mars. There research brought good news. They were able to produce species of plants that could tolerate harsh soil of Mars. So, after research men sown there first plant in Mars. The first plant was named “life". People took care of the plants very much as it was the only plant in Mars. Although water was very less in Mars still people watered the plant everyday. By coarse of time the plant grew and many seeds were found from them which were then used to produce many other plants in Mars. A lot of plants grew in Mars as a result one day the first ever rain occurred in Mars. People were so delighted and happy. The rain created a small river. Scientists examined the water of the river and announced that it was safe to drink. People started their new civilization centering the river as it was the only source of water. Thus a new journey of men began.
After some years when people were also stable in Mars and many mysteries of Mars were solved while exploring Mars, a scientist discovered something in water of Mars. It looked like an unicellular organism to him. He at first couldn’t believe when he examined it a few more times he reached to the decision that new life were forming in the water of Mars. It was a very delightful news ass men will stay with other life in the Mars. Evolution would create different animals by coarse of time.
Everything was going right in Mars. People were finally happy and the days of the Martians passed in delight.
On the other hand people in Earth were trying to make the world habitable again. It was a very hard work but hands of billions of people were together. At first people ensured there living areas and made them stable first they were filtering and boiling water from polluted water of sea. There was no technology. So it can be said people lagged behind hundreds of years. But they didn’t lose hope. They started to make the world like what they want to look at.
Many times have passed. The Martians created a big civilization in Mars. They created a well protected small city in Mars and made some areas of the planet green. On the other hand, after many years Earth changed its look once again. But it was in the positive side. People tried their best and combining billions of people the Earth finally started to become green once again. They also developed technology again to some level.
Now there is peace in both Earth and Mars. People of both planets are happy.
The people of Mars remembered the time they left Earth. They wanted to come back in Earth and see how was it then. They expected Earth in much bad scenario . But when they came in Earth they were totally stunned at what they saw on Earth. They saw that the Earth is in a better situation. They landed their spaceship in an open area. There was a small town nearby where they landed their spaceship. The people in the spaceship came down on the land. This time was finally the time when they landed on Earth. They took there first breath in natural air for the very first time after years. They started exploring the Earth. Whilst exploring they reached the small town nearby mentioned before.
The people on Earth saw the people of the spaceship and were surprised for a time. After introduction the people of spaceship explored the newly made Earth and were very astonished by it. They stayed in Earth for some days. By this time they saw how people were living emitting no co2 or doing any harm to the nature or environment. After these they again went away to Mars. The people of Earth and the people of Mars set up a mutual communication between them. So that the people of Earth and the people of Mars could communicate visit each other with ease. Then people of Earth and people of Mars lived peacefully.
In this way men learnt their greatest lesson to live with the environment and also inhabit Mars.
