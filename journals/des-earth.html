          Mia wakes up very early in the morning. She looks at the calendar 27 June, 4020. Her dusty vacation starts from today. She sighs. She doesn’t want to stay alive in this world. The world is a desert now. It’s called Des-Earth now. In ancient periods, it’s known as Earth. The beautiful planet. But now dust is everywhere. There’s no green in the city. The sky looks always gloomy and misty. The sun is an evil. Now it gives only UV ray. That's why, people always wear UV-protector dress. The main life-saver gas Oxygen said goodbye to this world thousand years ago. People carry a Oxygen bag with them. She looks through window with tearful eye. The dust storm will start anytime. It comes every year in August stayed 6 months.
“Mia?” Her mom came to the room.
“Yes!”
“Come On! Have your breakfast.”
Her mom didn’t ask what’s the reason of her crying. Because now people don’t wonder when someone cries. People wonder when someone smiles.
She goes to the dining room and stared at the food. That same tasteless artificial food.
“Mom! I don’t want to eat this.”
“Okay, then don’t eat. Our food will save for more day.”
Mia become angry and said, “Are you my mom? Have you ever study history? Don’t you know mom's quality? How should to react in this situation?”
Her mom bite a bread and said, “Don’t get hyper it’ll waste more Oxygen.”
Mia just wanted to cry. She ran to her room and decide to left the home. She took her grandfather’s diary and album, wear UV-protector.
Before leaving the house she said “I’m going mom. You, please focus on saving food and oxygen to live longer in this dead world.”
“Okay, I even don’t want you. Leave this home like your mad father.”
Mia slammed the door as hard as possible and started to walk.
There’s no vehicle in this world now. World’s changed so much that people are focusing to produce more and more Oxygen they can. The ancient scientists and researchers wanted to create everything to bring the world at their feet. They succeeded too. But the outcome of their success is now a curse. All of those inventions proved as useless with time. People of 4020 just wants to
stay alive. They don’t want a posh life. Their only desire is Oxygen, some food to eat and UV-protector.
The world goes back to like ancient period when no digital products were available. But the difference is that time nature was the ruler and now “Nature” is like a fairy tale. Human already killed nature cruelly. Now our surroundings are toxic.
Mia’s thinking these things. Suddenly, she saw whole area become brighter. Mia thought that dust storm might occur any time. She had nothing to do but to wait for the storm. She knows that she’s going to die soon but she feels nothing.
Mia sit on the rough ground and awaiting for her death. All on a sudden, she feels earthquake. Then she can’t believe her eyes. Beautiful birds are flying in the sky. The whole area become green and green. Trees, grass, flowers growing here and there. The sky looks so blue that she can’t but to stare at. Every single thing looks like a picture which she saw in her grandmother’s old photo album.
By seeing these, she felt very good and start thinking that everything’s going to be normal. So why she is wearing this protector, she thought.
She's going to take off her protector. At that time, she felt like someone’s standing behind her. She’s about to turn but realized that her feet and hands are locked. The person come in front of her. She’s amazed by seeing a beautiful woman standing in front of her eyes. She’s holding a machine and ask Mia, “Why are you outside now?”
With a little break again ask, “Why aren’t you inside your own home?”
Mia answered, “I’ve left my home. I don’t live in this world anymore.”
The woman wonders and ask “Why not?” Mia replied with a loud tone, “Don’t you know that this world is a trash now.”
“Oh! You want to die. Okay, let me shoot you.”
“Hey, wait! It’s true that I want to die. But obviously don’t want to die with lots of curiosity. Could you tell me what’s going on actually?”
“You little kid, so much curiosity is injurious to health.”
“You’re going to kill me. So, it doesn’t matter whether you tell or not. The secret would never came out. Just think it’s a last wish of mine.”
She laughs without any happiness. It’s just some terrible sounds seems like she also forgets to laugh. Then says, “I can’t. You! Humans are so distrustful and destructive.”
“One more question. Where are we going right now?”
“Headquarter.”
The beautiful woman took Mia to their Headquarter. Mia’s looking at the headquarter. It’s look like an old scrap. The beautiful woman entered some codes and the door opened. They entered. Mia looked around. She’s watching everything in amazement. There’s no smoggy feelings. It’s clean and fresh. Trees and flowers are here and there. Everything is so real. An object is also flying with it’s wings.
Mia asked with a shout, “What’s it?”
“A butterfly.”
Mia suddenly feels very bad for the butterfly. She said, “I’m sorry butterfly on the behalf of mankind. We snatched your name and others name and existence like you.”
The beautiful woman said harshly, “Stop talking nonsense. Sit on the bench. I’ll be back in sometime.” And she left the room.
After sometime, a middle-aged man entered but didn’t notice Mia. He sat in front of a monitor and start working. Mia got shocked after seeing him. The middle-aged man was none but her own father who leave them years ago. She said in a low voice by controlling herself, “Dad?”
No reply came from the man.
She carefully goes closer to the man and said, “Dad....”
Finally, the man looked up and said, “Why are calling me dad? Do I know you? And what are you doing here? Who allowed you to enter?”
“I’m Mia. Don’t you remember? I’m your daughter. You left us years ago. Don’t you remember anything?”
The middle-aged man gazed at her for a few seconds. He was about to say something. Then Mia realized that she’s fully covered with protector.
She said, “Dad, open my oxygen mask. But at first untie this shackles. I’ve evidence that I’m your daughter. I’ve an album and a diary of my grandfather.”
The man opened Mia’s bag hurriedly and took the album and diary. He opened it and then he understood that Mia is his daughter. He hug her and said, “I’m sorry my dear. I had no other choice but to leave you.”
Her father untied the shackles. Mia said, “I missed you so much. Will you tell me what’s going on?”
“Of course. I’ll tell you my child.” Then he shouted, “Riro? Riro? Come here quickly.”
That beautiful woman came out and asked, “What happened, Sir Nomar?” She angrily looked at Mia and triggered gun and said, “You little stupid girl, what have you done?”
“Hey, Riro. Stop! Stop. She’s my daughter. Mia.”
“What? Your daughter?”
“Yeah. And she brings that precious treasure what we were searching for years.”
“Sir Yeamar's Diary!”
“Yes.”
Then Nomar turned to Mia and said, “I’ll tell you whole story later. Come with me. I need to unlock you and one more thing you can now take off your protector. Here’s no need of it.”
Mia took a bath and have some food which wasn’t artificial. A real and natural food.”
Three of them sat in a room. Nomar started to talk. He said, “Now listen, you were a child then. Your mom and I had a fight and I's angry with your mom. I came out in our lawn and saw a woman. She bowed and said, “Are you the only child of Sir Yeamar?”
I said, “Yes. Who are you?”
“I’ll tell you but you’ve to come with me now.”
I went with her. She took me to an spaceship. I saw lots of older people. They said “We’ve come from a planet named Mirisha. A small but well-developed planet. Our people care and conscious about their home. They look like Human but they have less chromosome than human. That’s why, we can’t be evil like you people.”
By listening this I got very rude with them and said, “If you'd called me to tell how evil we are, then I’ve to go.”
The Commander said, “You’re precious to us and also to your own planet. Many years ago, we contacted with Sir Yeamar to improve our planet as like Earth. By researching, we found Earth is the best for living beings so we decided to live in Earth also as human are harmful for this planet. But Earth’s losing its ability of rotation for environmental imbalances. It’ll stop rotating and would deviate from its orbit.”
“Darn it! We’ve to do something.”
“Human will not come forward as they’re used to with this toxic environment. So, we’re trying to save your Earth. Because if the Earth separates from its orbit, it’ll directly hit with our ten time smaller planet, Minisha. Both planets will be destroyed. We need your cooperation Sir.”
Norman looked at Mia and said, “I’d left home for this, not because of anger. Anyways, since then I started repairing the world. We’ve filtered water, soil and air with anti-chemical filter. We removed heavy metals and plastics as well as planted tresses so that creatures can survive.”
Mia asked, “If you repaired it then why the world is still same?”
Riro said, “It’s because we afraid of human. If they find out their planet is now as before, they could do harm again. Sir Yeamar invented a machine ‘Xiromar’ means our Headquarter. Xiromar makes you to see the Earth toxic and gloomy.”
Norman added, “Dusty storm is made with Xiromar to make people stay in home 6 months. So that we can do our work. Now we’re trying to recover ozone layer completely. We can do it with Xiromar but don’t know the operating functions. That’s why, we need my father’s diary.”
After 6 months later, the Earth’s back on track. Ozone layer isn’t completely recovered but improvement is satisfying. Mia is with her father for last 6 months and helps a lot to under her grandfather’s diary.
Riro congratulates both of them and said, “People of planet Minisha will never forget your work. You’re the lord, Sir Norman.”
Norman said, “Thank you Riro for saving our Earth.”
Mia said to Riro with worry, “You told that your people would come and live here. Please don’t do that. We’ll care our planet. Now people of Earth understand the value of Earth.”
Riro smiled and said, “We know human don’t want to leave Earth. Many years ago, scientists of Minisha decided to gift the Earth after once it’s repaired only for Sir Yeamar. Now Earth is yours. Do care of your Earth. Your Des-Earth turns into Earth again.”
