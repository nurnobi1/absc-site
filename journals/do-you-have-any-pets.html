          "It's high time you set free those mantises!" sparked Tommy.
"Well, how can a weird guy like you know even know about these small insects? At least, do you even have any pets?!" replied John.
"I have a gecko. And you don't have to pet an insect to know all about them!" exclaimed Tommy and barged out the playground.
Tommy always wanted to pet some mantises but deep inside, he knew pretty well that it was the geckos that he knew the best and felt the most affectionate for. Pretty weird for a random teen to choose a gecko in the first place!
Often he was seen researching about varies species of geckos in the library. His research extended such high rockets that he even possessed the knowledge of the genetic modification of the gecko species; and, his inquisitiveness and prowess is what earned him such a glorious reward.
When the all-famous researcher, Tony Stark visited our school last semester, he got attracted by Tommy's wisdom of insects. Mr. Stark was randomly throwing some questions at the students and discerning Tommy was smart and brave enough to reply to the questions portraying his cognition for insects and their modification immensely. Impressed and convinced, Mr. Stark soon offered Tommy a chance to visit his institute - Stark's Research and Development Centre.
This was the best thing that had happened to Tommy's life. Who knew that just by answering a series of random questions, he would earn himself a trip to such a mighty place?
Therefore, Tommy was all set to explore the centre and being eccentric enough, he had no friends. Thus, he took his lovely pet, gecko and visited the place one fine weekday.
What a massive place it was! If not for this place, he would have never known that there were researchers who dealt with similar interests like him. He found researchers all busy with their difficult tasks. Some were cheerful enough to talk and explain their insights to Tommy. To his wildest fantasy, Tommy discovered how researchers created gigantic rats about a cat's size by using specifications of mitosis and cloning several tiny rats. All this while, Tommy's gecko was on his hand while he happily learnt new stuffs.
However, Tommy soon noticed that the gecko was not in his hand anymore. It had ventured out from his hand. After about half an hour of rigorous searching, he soon found his dear gecko near the cloned rats. It was already late and time had arrived for Tommy to say goodbye to Mr. Stark and leave.
Tommy went home with jubilant memories; but still, something was not right. His gecko seemed to behave quite unusually and had stopped taking its food. Tommy was even tired to even try to feed the gecko; hence, he kept the gecko in the glasshouse and slept, thinking he will deal with the gecko in the morning.
His sleep was soon broken at midnight as heard something. A sound of something gigantic.
Moonlight from his window was shadowed by an enormous creature which was about his height. This petrified Tommy to death. Sweat filled his head and adrenaline pumped through his veins. He just couldn't believe his eyes and stayed frozen to understand what it was.
It was quite soon when he discovered, that the creature wasn't anything but his gecko...
